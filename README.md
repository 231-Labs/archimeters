# Archimeters 🏛️

A revolutionary parametric design platform on the Sui blockchain that transforms NFTs through functional 3D designs. Archimeters bridges digital creation with physical manufacturing, providing unique model configuration, real-time previewing, and secure asset generation via Sui's Walrus decentralized storage.

[繁體中文版](README.zh-TW.md) 🌏

## Vision 🔮

Archimeters reimagines NFTs by connecting digital designs with real-world utility. While traditional NFTs often rely on community sentiment or roadmaps for value proposition, we focus on intrinsic functionality:

- **Parametric Design Monetization**: Enabling designers to create algorithmic designs with perpetual revenue streams
- **Meaningful User Participation**: Users become co-creators by adjusting parameters to produce personalized designs
- **Real Asset Generation**: Digital designs transform into physical products through our companion project Eureka
- **True Decentralized Ownership**: Leveraging Sui Walrus for secure, censorship-resistant decentralized storage

## Quick Start 🚀

1. Clone the project and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/231-Labs/archimeters.git
cd archimeters/frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser 🌐
